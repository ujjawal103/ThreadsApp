RESt :-
     Representational State Transfer

     REST is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services.

     (RESTful API's) :- spi we will create & RESt is rules to define a API.
                           (Follow ---- CRUD operation (Create , Read , Update , Delete))


CRUD operation :-
                 GET    retrieve resources.
                 POST   submits new data to the server.
                 PUT    updates existing data
                 PATCH  update existing data partially
                 DELETE removes data



// Quora Post (Example)   

          We use :- 
                   GET       /posts      to get data for all posts         (index ROUTE)
                   POST      /posts      to add a new post                 (CREATE route) 
                   GET       /posts/:id  to get one post (using id)        (VIEW route)
                   PATCH     /posts/:id  to update specific post           (Update ROUTE) 
                   DELETE    /posts/:id  to delete specific post           (Destroy Route) 
           

these are the routes for different works but same route <-----  RESTfull API's.
